# Personal [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) configuration
> NOTE: Designed for 1920x1080, 1366x768 and 1024x768, would need minor tweaks for higher resolutions.


## Features
- Separate themes for Legacy and UEFI modes.
- [WIP] Icons for _(almost)_ everything!
- Themes are modified to provide support for:
  - Ventoy specific hotkeys (ex: F5 for Tools)
  - Indicators for **ALL** Ventoy's advanced modes (ex: Memdisk Mode)
